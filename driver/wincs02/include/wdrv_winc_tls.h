  Summary:
    TLS cipher suite callback.

  Description:
    Callback will be called to provide TLS cipher suite information.

  Parameters:
    handle        - Client handle obtained by a call to WDRV_WINC_Open.
    tlsCsHandle   - TLS cipher suite handle obtained by a call to WDRV_WINC_TLSCipherSuiteOpen.

    numAlgorithms - Number of cipher suite algorithms in the buffer provided.
    success       - Flag indicating if the operation was a success.

  Returns:
    None.

  Remarks:
    When used with WDRV_WINC_TLSCipherSuiteAlgSet, if any individual cipher
    suites are in error this callback will be called with pAlgorithms pointing
    to the cipher suite that failed (and numAlgorithms will be 1). The overall
    success or failure of the operation will be indicated by a final call to the
    callback with pAlgorithms being NULL.

    When used with WDRV_WINC_TLSCipherSuiteAlgGet, the overall success or
    failure of the operation will be indicated by a single call to the callback.

    WDRV_WINC_Open must have been called to obtain a valid handle.
    WDRV_WINC_TLSCipherSuiteOpen must have been called to obtain a valid TLS cipher suite handle.

  Parameters:
    handle            - Client handle obtained by a call to WDRV_WINC_Open.
    tlsCsHandle       - TLS cipher suite handle obtained by a call to WDRV_WINC_TLSCipherSuiteOpen.
    pfTlsCsResponseCB - Pointer to user callback for the get response.
    getDefaults       - Flag indicating if default values should be returned.

  Returns:
    WDRV_WINC_STATUS_OK            - The request has been accepted.
    WDRV_WINC_STATUS_NOT_OPEN      - The driver instance is not open.
    WDRV_WINC_STATUS_INVALID_ARG   - The parameters were incorrect.
    WDRV_WINC_STATUS_REQUEST_ERROR - The request to the WINC was rejected.
    WDRV_WINC_STATUS_RETRY_REQUEST - Another request is being processed, try again.

  Remarks:
    None.
