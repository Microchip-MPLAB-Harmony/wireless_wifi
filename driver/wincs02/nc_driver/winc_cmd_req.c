/*****************************************************************************
  Description:
    Initialise a command request burst.

  Parameters:
    pBuffer           - Pointer to buffer to contain command request burst
    lenBuffer         - Length of buffer provided
    numCommands       - Number of commands expected to be in burst
    pfCmdRspCallback  - Pointer to callback function to receive burst status
    cmdRspCallbackCtx - Context value to pass to callback function

  Returns:
    A WINC_CMD_REQ_HANDLE handle or WINC_CMD_REQ_INVALID_HANDLE

  Remarks:
