### Development Tools
- WINC: [MPLAB X v5.4 ](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)
- WINC: [MPLAB® XC32 C/C++ Compiler v2.41](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers)

## Wireless Release v3.2.0
### New Features
- WINC: Adds support/Callback for ECC callback.
- WINC: Adds Support for ARM Cortex M0+ Hosts through GPIO & PIO interrupts. Earlier only EIC Interrupts were allowed.
- WINC: Updated cache maintenance option for PIC32MZ.
- PIC32MZW1: Add WLAN driver support and application examples for PIC32MZW1 device.

### Bug fixes
- WINC: Fixed MHC Component Manager menu for Wireless Bypass mode (Supported only for WINC1500 in this release).
- WINC: Improved documentation for WINC driver and application examples.
- WINC: SYS_Console related changes to reflect updates in core/csp/bsp v3.7.0.

### Known Issues
- WINC: SAMD21 + WINC3400 examples have IDE specific dependencies which may prevent them from functioning correctly.
This is a known issue which will be solved in a future release.
- PIC32MZW1:  - A run time exception occurs with the TCPIP network packet manager code generated by MHC. The workaround for this is:
    - Addition of line ```#define TCPIP_IF_PIC32MZW1``` in the project's configuration.h file.
    - Addition of the check ```|| defined(TCPIP_IF_PIC32MZW1)``` as shown below for defining the MAC frame offset in the file tcpip_packet.c
    ```
    #if defined(TCPIP_IF_PIC32WK) || defined(TCPIP_IF_PIC32MZW1)
    #define TCPIP_MAC_FRAME_OFFSET      (34+4)  
    ```
    - Do NOT overwrite this workaround when regenerating the project.
    - This is a known issue which will be solved in a future release.
- PIC32MZW1: TCP Tx occasionally stalls when 11n is enabled.
- PIC32MZW1: STA mode connection problems when multiple APs are present with the same SSID but different security settings.
- PIC32MZW1: Scanning is not supported in AP mode.
- PIC32MZW1: QoS Data unsupported in transmit path.

## Wireless Release v3.1.1
### New Features
- Added Bypass (Ethernet) mode support for WINC.
WINC1500 Socket Mode vs Ethernet Mode

The WINC modules are capable of operating in either Socket mode or Ethernet (A.K.A. bypass) mode.

•	Socket mode allows an application running on the host MCU to utilize the TCP/IP stack within the firmware of the WINC device, such that the host MCU does not need to run its own TCP/IP stack. This approach is memory efficient and faster to implement.
•	Ethernet (bypass) mode disables the TCP/IP stack within the firmware of the WINC device, instead the host MCU can only send and receive Ethernet frames. This mode allows the host MCU to operate its own TCP/IP stack treating the WINC device as a simple Ethernet controller. This approach provides flexibility.

### Bug fixes
- Fixed MHC menu for RTOS memory allocation size change (words to bytes).

### Known Issues
- Bypass mode currently works only with the reference example - wifi_winc_sta_bypass.
All other examples are configured to work with socket mode.
