WDRV_PIC32MZW_MAC_ADDR *const pPeerAddress
)
```

## Summary

Retrieve the current association peer device network address.  

## Description

Attempts to retrieve the network address of the peer device in the
current association.

## Precondition

WDRV_PIC32MZW_Initialize should have been called. WDRV_PIC32MZW_Open should have been called to obtain a valid handle. A peer device needs to be connected and associated.  

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| assocHandle | Association handle. |
| pPeerAddress | Pointer to structure to receive the network address.  

## Returns

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_OK* - pPeerAddress will contain the network address.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_NOT_OPEN* - The driver instance is not open.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_INVALID_ARG* - The parameters were incorrect.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_REQUEST_ERROR* - The request to the PIC32MZW was rejected
or there is no current association. 
*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_RETRY_REQUEST* - The network address is not available
but it will be requested from the PIC32MZW. 
*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_NOT_CONNECTED* - Not currently connected.
 

## Remarks

If the network address is not currently known to the driver (stored within the PIC32MZW) a request will be sent to the PIC32MZW and the return status will be WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_RETRY_REQUEST.
