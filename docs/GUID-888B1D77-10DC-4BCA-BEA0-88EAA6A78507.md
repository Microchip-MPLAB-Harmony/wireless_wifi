# SSL/TLS Control

This topic provides information on how to configure the SSL/TLS sessions.

Internally the WINC devices are configured to establish TLS sessions using a typical set of cipher suites. If the application wishes to alter that set this interface can be used.

The cipher suites are managed using a Cipher Suite context which the application can manipulate before sending to the WINC device. The default cipher suites can be obtained by calling the function WDRV_WINC_SSLCTXDefault to initialize a Cipher Suite Context with the default ciphers.

The application can query and configure the cipher suites using lists of IANA identifiers for each cipher suite. To retrieve the current list of ID the application can use the function WDRV_WINC_SSLCTXCipherSuitesGet. To import a list of cipher suites into a context the application can use the function WDRV_WINC_SSLCTXCipherSuitesSet.
Once a Cipher Suite Context has been updated it can be loaded into the WINC device using the function WDRV_WINC_SSLActiveCipherSuitesSet.
