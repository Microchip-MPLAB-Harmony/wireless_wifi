# BLE Operation

This topic provides information on how ATWINC3400 BLE operations are controlled.

The ATWINC3400 device includes BLE functionality, while this driver does not provide direct access to the BLE functionality it does
provide a control interface for enabling and disabling BLE functionality.

To enable BLE functionality the function WDRV_WINC_BLEStart can be called while the function WDRV_WINC_BLEStop disables
BLE operations. The application may use the function WDRV_WINC_BLEIsStarted to test if BLE functionality is currently enabled.
