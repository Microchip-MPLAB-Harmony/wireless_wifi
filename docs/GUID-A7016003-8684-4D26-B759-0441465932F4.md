# Client - BSS Context APIs

The BSS context contains information relevant to a BSS such as SSID and channel.
The structure ```WDRV_PIC32MZW_BSS_CONTEXT``` is provided to contain the context.
To initialize a context, the function ```WDRV_PIC32MZW_BSSCtxSetDefaults``` is provided, this ensures the context is in a known state.
The function ```WDRV_PIC32MZW_BSSCtxIsValid``` is provided to test if a context is valid. In some applications, a BSS context is valid even if an SSID is blank. Therefore this function can be informed whether a blank SSID is valid or not.
The SSID of the BSS can be configured using the function ```WDRV_PIC32MZW_BSSCtxSetSSID```.
The channel of the BSS can be configure using the function W```DRV_PIC32MZW_BSSCtxSetChannel```.
In some applications a BSS can be cloaked therefore the state can be configured in a BSS context using the function ```WDRV_PIC32MZW_BSSCtxSetSSIDVisibility``` to indicate if an BSS is considered visible or not.
