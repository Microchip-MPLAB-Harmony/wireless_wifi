# MPLABÂ® Harmony WINC WLAN Library

The MPLAB Harmony WINC Driver provides a high-level interface to the ATWINC1500 and ATWINC3400 Wi-Fi network
controller modules. The WINC Driver Library, in conjunction with the ATWINC1500 or ATWINC3400 module, allows an
application to:

- Join an existing 802.11 b/g/n 2.4GHz Wi-Fi Infrastructure network.
- Create an 802.11 Wi-Fi Ad Hoc of Soft AP network.
- Scan for other W-Fi devices in an area
- Supports BLE 4.0 provisioning and profiles in central and peripheral mode (ATWINC3400 only)

Below are the interfaces provided by the WINC WLAN library.
