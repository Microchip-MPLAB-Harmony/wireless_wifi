# Client Interface - Authentication Context APIs

The authentication context contains information relevant to the authentication mechanisms used in Wi-Fi. Currently supported are Open, WPA/WPA2/WPA3-Personal and WPA/WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise(EAP-TLS).
.
The structure ```WDRV_PIC32MZW_AUTH_CONTEXT``` is provided to contain the context.
To initialize a context, the function ```WDRV_PIC32MZW_AuthCtxSetDefaults``` is provided, which ensures the context is in a known state.
The function ```WDRV_PIC32MZW_AuthCtxIsValid``` is provided to test if a context is valid.
Each authentication type has at least one function which can be used to configure the type of authentication algorithm used as well as the parameters which are required.
