# Power Save Control

This topic provides information on how to control the power save modes of the WINC devices.

The application can set and get the current power save mode of the WINC device using the functions
WDRV_WINC_PowerSaveSetMode and WDRV_WINC_PowerSaveGetMode.
Some power save modes ensure the WINC device is available to monitor beacons from its BSS. The interval of monitoring can be set through the function WDRV_WINC_PowerSaveSetBeaconInterval.

Note: WDRV_WINC_PowerSaveSetMode should be called after WDRV_WINC_PowerSaveSetBeaconInterval to ensure the WINC device is fully configure for its chosen power save mode.
