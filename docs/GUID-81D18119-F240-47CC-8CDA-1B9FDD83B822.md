## Summary

Request a BSS scan is performed by the PIC32MZW.  

## Description

A scan is requested on the specified channels. An optional callback can
be provided to receive notification of the first BSS discovered.

## Precondition

WDRV_PIC32MZW_Initialize must have been called. WDRV_PIC32MZW_Open must have been called to obtain a valid handle.  

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| handle | Client handle obtained by a call to WDRV_PIC32MZW_Open. |
| channel | Channel to scan, maybe WDRV_PIC32MZW_CID_ANY in which case all enabled channels are scanned. |
| active | Use active vs passive scanning. |
| pSSIDList | Pointer to list of SSIDs to match on. |
| pfNotifyCallback | Callback to receive notification of first BSS found.  

## Returns

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_OK* - A scan was initiated.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_NOT_OPEN* - The driver instance is not open.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_REQUEST_ERROR* - The request to the PIC32MZW was rejected.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_INVALID_ARG* - The parameters were incorrect.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_SCAN_IN_PROGRESS* - A scan is already in progress.
 

## Remarks

If channel is WDRV_PIC32MZW_CID_ANY then all enabled channels are scanned. The enabled channels can be configured using WDRV_PIC32MZW_BSSFindSetEnabledChannels. How the scan is performed can be configured using WDRV_PIC32MZW_BSSFindSetScanParameters.
