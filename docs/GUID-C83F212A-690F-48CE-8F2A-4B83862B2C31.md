# WDRV_PIC32MZW_PowerSaveModeSet Function

## C

```c
WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS WDRV_PIC32MZW_PowerSaveModeSet
(
DRV_HANDLE handle,
WDRV_PIC32MZW_POWERSAVE_MODE powerSaveMode,
WDRV_PIC32MZW_POWERSAVE_CORRELATION picCorrelation,
WDRV_PIC32MZW_PS_NOTIFY_CALLBACK pfNotifyCallback
)
```

## Summary

Set the power-save/sleep mode for WiFi.  

## Description

Requests that the current power-save mode is changed to the one specified
according to the parameters.

## Precondition

WDRV_PIC32MZW_Initialize should have been called. WDRV_PIC32MZW_Open should have been called to obtain a valid handle. WiFi must not currently be configured as a Soft-AP  

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| handle | Client handle obtained by a call to WDRV_PIC32MZW_Open. |
| powerSaveMode | Power-save mode for WiFi. |
| picCorrelation | PIC-WiFi power-save correlation mode. |
| pfNotifyCallback | Callback function to receive sleep entry notification.  

## Returns

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_OK* - The request has been accepted.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_NOT_OPEN* - The driver instance is not open.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_INVALID_ARG* - The parameters were incorrect.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_REQUEST_ERROR* - The request to the PIC32MZW was rejected.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED* - The requested operation is not supported.
 

## Remarks

Async Correlation Mode: powerSaveMode is applied immediately. WSM/WDS mode will apply even though the PIC is currently in the RUN state.  Sync Correlation Mode: powerSaveMode is applied to the WiFi when the PIC next enters sleep mode.  In either mode, powerSaveMode of RUN will cause the WiFi to leave power-save mode and enter RUN mode.
