# WDRV_PIC32MZW_POWERSAVE_PIC_CORRELATION Enum

## C

```c
typedef enum
{
    /* Asynchronous correlation. Trigger of sleep mode entry/exit is done through software */
    WDRV_PIC32MZW_POWERSAVE_PIC_ASYNC_MODE = 0,
    
    /* Synchronous correlation. Trigger of sleep mode entry/exit is done through hardware */
    WDRV_PIC32MZW_POWERSAVE_PIC_SYNC_MODE = 1
} WDRV_PIC32MZW_POWERSAVE_PIC_CORRELATION;

```

## Summary

Defines the correlation between WiFi and PIC sleep modes.  

## Description

This enumeration defines the correlation between WiFi and PIC sleep modes.

WDRV_PIC32MZW_POWERSAVE_PIC_ASYNC_MODE -
PIC sleep entry forces WiFi into Sleep, PIC wakeup (non WiFi) can be independent
of the WiFi sleep modes. WiFi sleep entry can be independent of the PIC sleep mode
entry. WiFi wakeup to RUN mode will force PIC into RUN mode.

WDRV_PIC32MZW_POWERSAVE_PIC_SYNC_MODE -
PIC sleep entry forces the WiFi into sleep mode and vice-versa.
PIC wakeup forces the WiFi sleep exit(Run) and vice-versa.

## Remarks

None.
