# WDRV_PIC32MZW_PowerSaveSleepInactLimitSet Function

## C

```c
WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS WDRV_PIC32MZW_PowerSaveSleepInactLimitSet
(
DRV_HANDLE handle,
uint16_t u16SleepInactLimit
);
```

## Summary

Set the sleep inactivity(assoc-timeout) threshold/limit for power save operation (in beacon period count).  

## Description

Set the sleep inactivity threshold/limit value for power save operation.It is
given in units of Beacon period.

During power-save if there is no activity in the BSS for the number of beacons
specified by u16SleepInactLimit, a NULL frame will be sent to the AP.
This is done to avoid the AP de-authenticating the STA during an inactivity period.

A default value of 10(ie, 10 ms) is used by the WiFi stack as Inactivity timeout limit.
The user can override that value via this API

## Precondition

WDRV_PIC32MZW_Initialize should have been called. WDRV_PIC32MZW_Open should have been called to obtain a valid handle.  

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| handle | Client handle obtained by a call to WDRV_PIC32MZW_Open. |
| u16SleepInactLimit | Inactivity threshold in units of Beacon period.  

## Returns

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_OK* - The request has been accepted.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_NOT_OPEN* - The driver instance is not open.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_INVALID_ARG* - The parameters were incorrect.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_REQUEST_ERROR* - The request to the PIC32MZW was rejected.
 

## Remarks

WDRV_PIC32MZW_PowerSaveSleepInactLimitSet should be called before WDRV_PIC32MZW_BSSConnect.
