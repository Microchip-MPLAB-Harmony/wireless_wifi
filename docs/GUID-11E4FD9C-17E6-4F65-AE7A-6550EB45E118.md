# MPLABÂ® Harmony PIC32MZW1 WLAN Library

The PIC32MZW1 Wi-Fi module consists of two instances, a control instance and a data instance. The control instance is driven as a conventional Harmony system interface by the system kernel or scheduler to initialize and run the module, the data instance implements a Harmony TCP/IP stack MAC Driver module instance driven by the Harmony TCP/IP stack.

Below are the interfaces provided by the PIC32MZW1 WLAN library.
