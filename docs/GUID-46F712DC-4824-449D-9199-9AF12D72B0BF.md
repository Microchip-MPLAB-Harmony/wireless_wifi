# WDRV_PIC32MZW_APStart Function

## C

```c
WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS WDRV_PIC32MZW_APStart
(
DRV_HANDLE handle,
const WDRV_PIC32MZW_BSS_CONTEXT *const pBSSCtx,
const WDRV_PIC32MZW_AUTH_CONTEXT *const pAuthCtx,
const WDRV_PIC32MZW_BSSCON_NOTIFY_CALLBACK pfNotifyCallback
)
```

## Summary

Starts an instance of Soft-AP.  

## Description

Using the defined BSS and authentication contexts with an optional HTTP
provisioning context (socket mode only) this function creates and starts
a Soft-AP instance.

## Precondition

WDRV_PIC32MZW_Initialize should have been called. WDRV_PIC32MZW_Open should have been called to obtain a valid handle. A BSS context must have been created and initialized. An authentication context must have been created and initialized.  

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| handle | Client handle obtained by a call to WDRV_PIC32MZW_Open. |
| pBSSCtx | Pointer to BSS context. |
| pAuthCtx | Pointer to authentication context. |
| pfNotifyCallback | Pointer to notification callback function.  

## Returns

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_OK* - The request has been accepted.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_NOT_OPEN* - The driver instance is not open.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_INVALID_ARG* - The parameters were incorrect.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_REQUEST_ERROR* - The request to the PIC32MZW was rejected.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_INVALID_CONTEXT* - The BSS context is not valid.
 

## Remarks

If pBSSCtx and pAuthCtx are both NULL then no AP will be established, however the pfNotifyCallback callback will still be accepted, even if an AP is active.
