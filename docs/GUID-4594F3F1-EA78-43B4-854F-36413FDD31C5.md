# Client Interface - Soft AP mode APIs

The PIC32MZW1 device can create a Soft-AP allowing a Wi-Fi station device to connect to the PIC32MZW1.
To create a Soft-AP the function ```WDRV_PIC32MZW_APStart``` is called.

This function takes several context structures to config aspects of the Soft-AP operation, these contexts are:
-	BSS		- Describes the BSS which will be created.
-	Authentication	- Describes the security level to be used.

Specification of a BSS context is required. If no authentication context is provided, the Wi-Fi driver will create a Soft-AP with no security.

A callback is also provided to update the application on events.
To stop using the Soft-AP the function ```WDRV_PIC32MZW_APStop``` is called.
