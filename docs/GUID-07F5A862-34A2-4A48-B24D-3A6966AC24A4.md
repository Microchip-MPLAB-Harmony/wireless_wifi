## C

```c
typedef bool (*WDRV_WINC_BSSFIND_NOTIFY_CALLBACK)

```

## Summary

Callback to signal discovery of a BSS.  

## Description

When the information about a discovered BSS is requested the driver will
use this callback to provide the BSS information to the user.

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| handle | Client handle obtained by a call to WDRV_WINC_Open. |
| index | Index of BSS find results. |
| ofTotal | Total number of BSS find results. |
| pBSSInfo | Pointer to BSS information structure.  

## Returns

If true is returned the WINC driver will automatically fetch the next BSS find results which will cause a later call to this callback. If false is returned the WINC driver will not fetch the next BSS find results, the user must call WDRV_WINC_BSSFindNext to retrieve them.  

## Remarks

The callback function must return true or false. true indicates that the user wishes the next BSS information structure be provided. false indicates that the user will call WDRV_WINC_BSSFindNext to obtain the next BBS information structure.
