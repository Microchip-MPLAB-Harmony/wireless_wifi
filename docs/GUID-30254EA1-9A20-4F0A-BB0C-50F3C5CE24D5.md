## Summary

Defines frame filter mask values which is used while Rx/Tx of vendor IE tags.  

## Description

custom IE can be added while Tx and the frame types from which vendor
specific IE data can be extracted at Rx.

## Remarks

Bit position value 1 enables and 0 disables Rx/Tx of vendor IE data.
