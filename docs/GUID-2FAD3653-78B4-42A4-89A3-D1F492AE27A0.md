This topic provides information on general client operation.

**General Client Operation**

For the application to begin using an instance of the WINC module, it must call the WDRV_WINC_Open function. This provides the
configuration required to open the WINC instance for operation.

The function WDRV_WINC_Close closes an already opened instance of the WINC Driver, invalidating the handle.
WDRV_WINC_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.
