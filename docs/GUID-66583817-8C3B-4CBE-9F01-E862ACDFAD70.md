# WDRV_WINC_IPAddressSet Function

## C

```c
WDRV_WINC_STATUS WDRV_WINC_IPAddressSet
(
DRV_HANDLE handle,
uint32_t ipAddress,
uint32_t netMask
)
```

## Summary

Configures an IPv4 address.  

## Description

Disables DHCP on the WINC and assigns a static IPv4 address. The address
isn't applied to the WINC until a connection is formed.

## Precondition

WDRV_WINC_Initialize should have been called. WDRV_WINC_Open should have been called to obtain a valid handle. The WINC must not be connected.  

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| handle | Client handle obtained by a call to WDRV_WINC_Open. |
| ipAddress | IPv4 address. |
| netMask | IPv4 netmask.  

## Returns

*WDRV_WINC_STATUS_OK* - The address has been accepted.

*WDRV_WINC_STATUS_NOT_OPEN* - The driver instance is not open.

*WDRV_WINC_STATUS_INVALID_ARG* - The parameters were incorrect.

*WDRV_WINC_STATUS_REQUEST_ERROR* - The request to the WINC was rejected.
 

## Remarks

Only applicable when connected in infrastructure station mode. The top 8 bits of the IPv4 32 bit representation corresponds to the last byte of the IPv4 address, i.e. 192.168.0.1 = 0x0100A8C0
