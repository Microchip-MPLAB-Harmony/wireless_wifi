# Setup & Initialization

This topic provides information on setup/initialization.

The system performs the initialization of the device driver with settings that affect only the instance of the device that is being initialized.

The WDRV_WINC_Initialize function returns an object handle of the type SYS_MODULE_OBJ. After this, the object handle returned by the Initialize interface would be used by the other system interfaces such as WDRV_WINC_Deinitialize, WDRV_WINC_Reinitialize, WDRV_WINC_Status and WDRV_WINC_Tasks.
