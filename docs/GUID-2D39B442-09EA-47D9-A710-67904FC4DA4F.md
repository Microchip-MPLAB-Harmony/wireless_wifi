# WDRV_PIC32MZW_APRekeyIntervalSet Function

## C

```c
WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS WDRV_PIC32MZW_APRekeyIntervalSet
(
DRV_HANDLE handle,
const uint32_t interval
)
```

## Summary

Configures the group re-key interval used when operating in Soft-AP mode  

## Description

The re-key interval specifies how much time must elapse before a group re-key
is initiated with connected stations.
The timer is restarted after each group re-key.

## Precondition

WDRV_PIC32MZW_Initialize should have been called. WDRV_PIC32MZW_Open should have been called to obtain a valid handle.  

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| handle | Client handle obtained by a call to WDRV_PIC32MZW_Open. |
| interval | The time in seconds that must pass before each re-key attempt. The minimum time value is 60 seconds. Defaults to 86400.  

## Returns

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_OK* - The request has been accepted.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_NOT_OPEN* - The driver instance is not open.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_INVALID_ARG* - The parameters were incorrect.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_REQUEST_ERROR* - The request to the PIC32MZW was rejected.
 

## Remarks

Takes effect after the next re-key - if an interval other than the default is desired then it is recommended to call this API before calling WDRV_PIC32MZW_APStart.
