## Description

Management frames like, beacons, probe request and probe response may
contain an application provided custom IE. This function associates a custom
IE store context with the STA/AP instance.

## Precondition

WDRV_PIC32MZW_Initialize should have been called. WDRV_PIC32MZW_Open should have been called to obtain a valid handle. WDRV_PIC32MZW_CustIEStoreCtxSetStorage should have been called to create a valid IE store context.  

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| handle | Client handle obtained by a call to WDRV_PIC32MZW_Open. |
| frameMask | Frame filter mask to add custom IE store. |
| pCustIECtx | Pointer to custom IE store context.  

## Returns

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_OK* - The request has been accepted.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_NOT_OPEN* - The driver instance is not open.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_INVALID_ARG* - The parameters were incorrect.

*WDRV_PIC32MZW_STATUS_REQUEST_ERROR* - The request to the PIC32MZW was rejected.
 

## Remarks

1. Before calling the API WDRV_PIC32MZW_IECustTxDataSet it is expected that IE storage is created using the API WDRV_PIC32MZW_CustIEStoreCtxSetStorage. 2. IEs can be added to the storage or removed from the storage using APIs WDRV_PIC32MZW_CustIEStoreCtxAddIE and WDRV_PIC32MZW_CustIEStoreCtxRemoveIE. 3. To stop transmitting custom vendor specific IEs, this API can be called with frameMask = 0.
